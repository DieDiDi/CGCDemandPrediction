# Coupling layer-wise convolutional network for transportation demand prediction
Thanks for your interests! The data is available in: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1usoSQtzUk8JDh-v0B7f52g  with the password kyt9. Put the taxi_data.h5 and bike_data.h5 in data/nogrid.

Although the adjacency matrix generated by distance is not used in our method, we put it in the data/adj_data.zip.
