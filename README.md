# Coupling layer-wise convolutional network for transportation demand prediction
Thanks for your interests! The data is available in :https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Zv3CajiBehIGK2OOys9TEA with the password rjep. Put the taxi_data.h5 and bike_data.h5 in data/nogrid.

Although the adjacency matrix generated by distance is not used in our method, we put it in the data/adj_data.zip.
